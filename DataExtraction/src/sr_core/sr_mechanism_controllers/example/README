To get spline trajectory running :

* in simulation make sure you started the getJointState service

  rosrun sr_utilities get_joint_states.py /joint_states:=/gazebo/joint_states

* in real make sure you started the ordered hand arm merger (which contains the service)

  rosrun sr_utilities ordered_hand_arm_joint_states_merger.py


Examples
spline example requires joint_spline_trajectory_action_controller to be started
other examples require joint_trajectory_action_controller to be started

simple_trajectory_compare.cpp and simple_spline_trajectory.cpp are the same movement but for 2 different controllers
